DESCRIPTION
Replacing existing lines with the contents of a register is a very common task
during editing. Often, one wants to adapt the indent of the pasted lines to
the current indent, e.g. when replacing a nested conditional from a yank that
originated at a different nesting level.

This plugin combines the replacement functionality of the
ReplaceWithRegister.vim plugin with the indent-adjustment done by the
built-in ]p command. With a simple mapping, you can replace line(s) with the
contents of a register while adjusting the indent to that of the first
replaced line.

SEE ALSO
- ReplaceWithRegister.vim (vimscript #2703) implements the general case of
  replacing text including the indent (also with a {motion} mapping for
  arbitrary text, not just lines).

USAGE
[count]["x]grR          Replace [count] lines with the contents of register x
                        and adjust the indent to the first replaced line (like
                        pasting with ]p).
{Visual}["x]gR          Replace the selection with the contents of register x
                        and adjust the indent to the first selected line.
                        As the replacement is always entire lines, this only
                        works with linewise selections (V).
